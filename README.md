## Usage

Brompton makes use of `Makefiles` for ease of usage. To start a particular service you should run `make up-<service-name>`
e.g. `make up-homeassistant` to start the `homeassistant` service.

To stop a particular service, run `make stop-<service-name>` e.g. `make stop-homeassistant` to stop the `homeassistant` service.

There are shortcuts to bring everything up and down:

- `make up`
- `make down`
